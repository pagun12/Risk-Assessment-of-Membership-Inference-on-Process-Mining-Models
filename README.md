Risk Assessment of Membership Inferenceon Process Mining Models

Process mining provides a set of techniques that allow businesses to model and improve their processes. Process mining methods deliver results that are more appropriate and more reliable than conventional business modeling approaches. Therefore, it is not surprising that process mining has become a popular field of research in the scientific community. However, since process mining relies on event logs from processes, the aspect of privacy has also to be considered. The private data in these event logs can be targeted and exploited by adversaries. Studies have identified multiple privacy threats in process mining, such as membership inference. The threat of membership inference aims to disclose the members of event logs. This thesis tackles this problem and provides a detailed examination. To that end, we adapted the membership inference to predictive process monitoring models. Furthermore, we executed multiple membership inference attacks on process models. The targeted models were built with real life event logs from a Dutch hospital. Therefore, the data of these logs represent a sensitive target to adversaries. Our results show a high rate of success for membership inference attacks on process models and thus, highlight the need for privacy-securing measures. 

The outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring benchmark by Irene Teinemaa et al was used as basis for the experiment of this thesis.
